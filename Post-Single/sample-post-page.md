# Sample Post Page

This is a sample post page created in the Post-Single folder. Pages in this folder are specifically designed for single post content and will be automatically listed on the main post-single.md page.

## Post Content

This demonstrates how post pages should be structured when using the Markdown Editor in Pages mode with the Post-Single option enabled. The page will automatically appear in the post list with its title, publication date, and summary.

### Features:
- Proper YAML header with `is_page: True`
- Content organization in the Post-Single folder
- Automatically listed on the post-single.md page
- Summary support for preview text
- Consistent styling with other post pages

The Post-Single folder system makes it easy to manage individual post content collections without manual maintenance of link lists.
