# Test Content Submission

This is a test content submission to verify the GitHub Actions workflow system.

## Summary

This test content demonstrates how the automated content processing system works.

## Content

This is test content that will be automatically processed by the GitHub Actions workflow. The system should:

1. **Detect this file** in the pending-content folder
2. **Create a new branch** with timestamp format
3. **Move the content** to the appropriate final folder
4. **Create a pull request** for review
5. **Clean up** the pending content

## Test Features

- **Markdown support** for rich content
- **Automatic processing** via GitHub Actions
- **No manual intervention** required
- **Uses GITHUB_TOKEN** automatically

## Expected Results

After this file is committed to the main branch:

1. The `create-content-branch.yml` workflow should trigger
2. A new branch should be created: `updatecontent-15-01-2025-14-30-25`
3. Content should be moved to: `Post-Single/test-content-submission-test123.md`
4. A pull request should be created for review
