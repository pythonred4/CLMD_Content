# Markdown Editor Auto-Embed Preview

This post demonstrates how the markdown editor now shows **real-time auto-embed previews** exactly like they would appear on the Hugo site.

## Test the Editor

Go to the [Markdown Editor](/markdown-editor/) and try pasting these URLs to see the auto-embed preview:

### Sample Video URLs
```
https://pomf.lain.la/f/sample-video.mp4
https://files.catbox.moe/test-video.webm
https://qu.ax/demo-video.mov
https://cdn.videy.co/video123.mp4
```

### Sample Image URLs  
```
https://files.catbox.moe/sample-image.jpg
https://qu.ax/test-image.png
https://pomf.lain.la/f/photo.gif
https://0x0.st/image456.webp
```

### Sample Audio URLs
```
https://0x0.st/audio123.mp3
https://qu.ax/sound.wav
https://pomf.lain.la/f/music.flac
```

## How It Works

1. **Real-time Detection**: As you type URLs from supported hosts, the preview automatically detects them
2. **Live Embed Rendering**: Shows exactly how media will appear on the Hugo site
3. **Modal Functionality**: Click on videos/images in the preview to test modal behavior
4. **Host Attribution**: Shows which service hosts the media
5. **Responsive Design**: Preview adapts to different screen sizes

- ‚úÖ **qu.ax** (`qu.ax`)
- ‚úÖ **Videy** (`cdn.videy.co`)
